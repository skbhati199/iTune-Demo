# iTune-Demo

The code challenge for you is to create an app with a ListView that will load Michael jackson songs from Itunes Api.

For the json data you can call the url below:
https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=Michael+jackson

All the images should be loaded into the ListView asyncronously for smooth scrolling.
Extra points: When an item is clicked open another view to display some more details.

## Requirement 
 - Android Studio
 - Retrofit
 - Gson
 - DataBinding
 - ViewModel
 - Room Database
 - Dagger
 - RxJava2 and RxAndroid
